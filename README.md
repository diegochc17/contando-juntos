# Contando Juntos ðŸ•’

**Inclusive classroom timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
Created to help neurodivergent students stay calm, focused, and engaged during class activities.

### ðŸ’¡ About the Project
While volunteering at **Creciendo Juntos**, an inclusive learning center in Peru, I saw that many students grew anxious when they lost track of time during lessons.  
To support them, I developed **Contando Juntos** â€” a simple web app that uses **music and animations** to make time management predictable and encouraging.

This project represents my belief that technology can be both **empathetic and practical**.

### ðŸ§© Impact
Used in classroom activities at *Creciendo Juntos* to help students with ADHD and autism manage time more comfortably.  
Teachers reported calmer transitions and improved engagement.
